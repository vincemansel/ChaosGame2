Chaos game draws a coherent fractal image for certain combinations of vertices and dividers
based on a random rendering technique. 3 vertices and a 2 divider create a compelling result.
This program is an experimental simulation to discovery if # of vertices > 3 and dividers > 2
yields useful, coherent results.
